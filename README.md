# GitHub-Project-Highlights
Hi, I’m Alen — a software & AI engineer passionate about clean architecture and practical systems. These are my key projects showing depth in AI/ML, engineering design, and tooling.

## ⭐ **1. J Text Exploration Library (Foundational Architecture)**

**Tech:** Python, custom parsing utilities, modular walkers
**Repo:** [alenjiji/J] (https://github.com/alenjiji/J)

* Designed and implemented the core parsing and structural exploration library for **Project J**.
* Built deterministic token-handling, structural nodes, and modular walkers.
* Developed a foundation intended for future **A*-guided semantic traversal** — *currently unimplemented by design*.
* Project is **paused at the successful foundational library stage**, ready for future expansion.

**Highlights:** architecture-first design, deterministic logic, extensible framework.

## ⭐ **2. Encrypted Proxy Tunnel (Real-Time Networking System)**

**Tech:** Python, AsyncIO, TLS, AES, TCP, Chrome/Firefox proxy integration
**Repo:** *(private / experimental)*

* Developed an encrypted multi-layer proxy capable of handling real-time CONNECT flows.
* Built robust error-handling, request delegation, tunnel negotiation, and fallback mechanisms.
* Continuously improved speeds across multiple phases (Phase 1 → Phase 4).
* Achieved stable Firefox performance and progressive Chrome compatibility.

**Highlights:** networking internals, encryption, performance tuning, real-world debugging.

## ⭐ **3. DubbingTracker — Architecture-Driven Desktop Application**

**Tech:** C++, Qt Widgets, Clean Architecture, GitHub Actions CI
**Repo:** *(internal work)*

* Implemented a strict **Qt-free core** with UI adapters for clean separation.
* Built core domains: ProjectManager, MarkerManager, SyncController — all deterministic and unit-testable.
* Maintained a **40ms sync tolerance invariant**, enforced via test design.
* Refactored MainWindow into a small, elegant **composition root (<150 LOC)**.
* Integrated CI gating, layered architecture enforcement, and clear domain boundaries.

**Highlights:** engineering discipline, modularity, deterministic design, professional architecture.

## ⭐ **4. Nanma-NX Media Suite**

**Repo:** [alenjiji/Nanma-NX-Media-Suite](https://github.com/alenjiji/Nanma-NX-Media-Suite)
**Tech:** Python, media processing, batch automation utilities

* Built a media-handling suite for batch conversions and workflow automation.
* Designed modular components for clean extension and easy tool reuse.
* Future-ready foundation for integrating AI-powered media features.

**Highlights:** reliability, tooling, modular automation.

## ⭐ **5. Solitaire Game (Algonquin College — Co-op)**

**Tech:** C#, Blueprint-style logic, Agile/SCRUM
**Repo:** *(academic)*

* Contributed gameplay logic, interaction design, and iterative development.
* Participated in a 5-member Agile team with sprint-based delivery.

**Highlights:** teamwork, gameplay logic, feature development.
